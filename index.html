            <li>
                I was responsible for creating player movement, map design (Bow room, Old Man room), progression
                (collectables, transitions, etc), and sounds.
            </li>
            <li>
                For our custom mechanic, I was responsible again for creating a new map design and progression. In
                additon, I added more mechanics related to map interaction.
                I played a big part in quality assurance and testing!!!

                The technologies used were C# for scripting and Unity as our game engine. Github was used a version
                management and Jira for organization.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shoutout to Michael Xi for building the weapons and enemies! The epic boss fight was done by him!!!

                The gold spike feature is a grappling hook that you can attach yourself to walls with. You can swing and
                pull yourself with the hook, but beware that some things can cut your rope!

        <h4> What I did</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I did a good amount of work on the enemies-> mostly non-boss enemies AI and spriting
            </li>
            <li>
                I designed and implemented the artifacts from effects, particles, sprites, UI, and interaction with the
                player
            </li>
            <li>
                I helped with some of the upgrades with the skill tree (linking the UI to the actual upgrades to player)
            </li>
            <li>
                Created the colosseum. I hope you enjoyed the king dog and the cutscene.
            </li>
            <li>
                Made the cute start up scene
            </li>
            <li>
                Worked Death Menu UI and Height UI
            </li>
            <li>
                Worked on the earlier iterations of the movement and player controls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Made the fountain give healing and particles for it (not the sprite and actual animation of the
                fountain)
            </li>
            <li>
                Helped implement some of the sounds and music.
            </li>
            <li>
                Primary worked on a ton with balancing. From tweaking numbers on weapon upgrades, speed, weather
                strength, enemies, artifacts, and the bosses. This was a lot of work although still needs tons of more
                hours and testing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tons of playtesting and bug reporting.
            </li>
