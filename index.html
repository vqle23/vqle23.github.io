                I was responsible for creating player movement, map design (Bow room, Old Man room), progression
                (collectables, transitions, etc), and sounds.
            </li>
            <li>
                For our custom mechanic, I was responsible again for creating a new map design and progression. In
                additon, I added more mechanics related to map interaction.
                I played a big part in quality assurance and testing!!!

                The technologies used were C# for scripting and Unity as our game engine. Github was used a version
                management and Jira for organization.

                The gold spike feature is a grappling hook that you can attach yourself to walls with. You can swing and
                pull yourself with the hook, but beware that some things can cut your rope!
